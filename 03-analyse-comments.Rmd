```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

judgements <- read_csv("judgements_all.csv")
```

# Items

```{r}
items <- read_csv("scripts.csv") %>% mutate(item_description = str_trim(item_description))

items %>% knitr::kable()
```
These items are abbreviated in the figure:

```{r}
items %>% 
  filter(str_to_lower(item_name) != str_to_lower(item_description)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
item_key <- items %>% select(item_num, item_name) %>% deframe()
```


# Comments

```{r}
all_relevant_judgements <- judgements %>% 
  # restrict to the binary choices
  filter(str_detect(study, "pairs")) %>% 
  # replace item numbers with names
  mutate(across(c(left, right, won, lost), ~ recode(., !!!item_key))) %>% 
  select(-left, -right, -score, -time_taken) %>% 
  arrange(study, judge_id)

judgements_with_comments <- all_relevant_judgements %>% 
  filter(str_length(comment) > 0)
```

Out of `r nrow(all_relevant_judgements)` these are the `r nrow(judgements_with_comments)` with comments:

```{r}
judgements_with_comments %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Slider conditions

Interestingly comments seemed to be more common in the slider condition.

```{r}
all_relevant_judgements <- judgements %>% 
  # restrict to the slider conditions
  filter(str_detect(study, "slider")) %>% 
  # replace item numbers with names
  mutate(across(c(left, right), ~ recode(., !!!item_key))) %>% 
  select(-won, -lost, -time_taken) %>% 
  arrange(study, judge_id)

judgements_with_comments <- all_relevant_judgements %>% 
  filter(str_length(comment) > 0)
```

Out of `r nrow(all_relevant_judgements)` these are the `r nrow(judgements_with_comments)` with comments:

```{r}
judgements_with_comments %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
